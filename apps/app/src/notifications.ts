The community is now in charge of the game's future, which is a great opportunity to make it awesome again!

To celebrate this new era, I've added the option to select rulesets when creating a new squadron, so you can play with 2.0 Legacy points, XWA points or whatever the community will come up with next.

Also the app got a bit of new polish ðŸ˜Š
Some features are still missing, but I'm working on it and plan on releasing them soon.

Best Regards, AndrÃ©`,
