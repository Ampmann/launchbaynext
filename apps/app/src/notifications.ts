The community is now in charge of the game's future, which is a great opportunity to make it even better.

To celebrate this new era, I've added the option to select rulesets when creating a new squadron, so you can play with 2.0 Legacy points, XWA points or whatever the community will come up with next.

Also the app got a bit of new polish (some features are still missing, but I'm working on it) ðŸ˜Š

Best Regards, AndrÃ©

PS. Don't buy AMG product.`,
